This is an audio visualizer that displays the waveform of the music its playing. There are several options for the visuals to choose from, and they can be changed in real time while the music is playing. The graphics are handled by a library called wave.js, while the site itself is a single-page app built in react so that the type of animation can be changed seamlessly while the music is playing. Right now it only has one Creative Commons song, but others may be added later.
